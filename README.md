# The-Chillager
The chillager is a festive boss planned for Winter Jam, it would have various abilities and a handful of possible drops, only spawning in snowy biomes at night. Similar to the Harvester’s Night mod by Lykrast, The Chillager can be heard making distinct sound when he spawns (jingling and a ho-ho-ho in a raspy voice), this way people can tell if he has spawned. 

Fighting The Chillager:

When you are seen by Mr. Chillager, he will immediately begin trying to attack you and will begin by throwing presents at you which explode and give you poison for a short amount of time, at this first stage he will also attempt to punch you, this punch of his would have the same effect as being hit with knockback 2, the key to fighting him in this stage would be shooting him with a bow or running at him while he throws his presents.

When he is at half health he will spawn four tiny illager elf minions to beat you up while he sits there and regens a little bit of health, these tiny dudes drop candy canes, a new food item that when eaten, will give you potion effects for a short time. They also have a chance to drop a pointy green hat.

In his final stage, he will shoot wither presents instead of poison and alternate between this, and punching you, where you would have to run around him to avoid the presents while hitting him, or get far away from him and shoot him with a bow.

When he dies, he will place a big present on the ground that you can open to recieve random select items, and paper (because I’m all about attention to detail). 

Items:
-Present Launcher Prototype
Exactly how it sounds, an explosive present launcher with a flintlock mechanism that...somehow magically creates said explosive… but like...how? I guess no one will ever know. Hold down the right mouse button to charge it up like a bow and fire an explosive surprise that hits for 10 HP. Can be obtained from the large present.

-Pinemetal Sword
A mysterious sword that looks kinda like a pine tree, every mob killed with this sword has a chance to drop a normal present, which when opened, will give you a random item (except boss drops, Gingerbread Notch is an exception though) and a guaranteed paper drop. This sword is as good as diamond and can be obtained from the large present The Chillager drops.
-Gingerbread Notch
The Gingerbread Notch is a peculiar looking cookie that when eaten, will give you the same effects as a Notch apple plus speed! It can be obtained from the large present in stacks of 3-5, or a single one from the normal presents
-Peppermint Pick
The peppermint pick is pickaxe with a mining level of diamond and the durability of iron, when mining with this pick, you have a chance to get different kinds of candy cane drops.
-Festive Armor Set
The festive armor set will drop along side other large present drops and...will look uh...festive.
