# The-Chillager
The chillager is a festive boss planned for Winter Jam, it would have various abilities and a handful of possible drops, only spawning in snowy biomes at night. Similar to the Harvester’s Night mod by Lykrast, The Chillager can be heard making distinct sound when he spawns (jingling and a ho-ho-ho in a raspy voice), this way people can tell if he has spawned. 

Fighting The Chillager:

When you are seen by Mr. Chillager, he will immediately begin trying to attack you and will begin by throwing presents at you which explode and give you poison for a short amount of time, at this first stage he will also attempt to punch you, this punch of his would have the same effect as being hit with knockback 2, the key to fighting him in this stage would be shooting him with a bow or running at him while he throws his presents.

When he is at half health he will spawn four tiny illager elf minions to beat you up while he sits there and regens a little bit of health, these tiny dudes drop candy canes, a new food item that when eaten, will give you potion effects for a short time. They also have a chance to drop a pointy green hat.

In his final stage, he will shoot wither presents instead of poison and alternate between this, and punching you, where you would have to run around him to avoid the presents while hitting him, or get far away from him and shoot him with a bow.

When he dies, he will place a big present on the ground that you can open to recieve random select items, and paper (because I’m all about attention to detail). 


Configurability:
-Being able to set the rate at which the Chillager spawns
-Whitelist and blacklist to present drops so people can add custom drops
-Config option to toggle tiny illager elves to spawn naturally in chilly biomes (off by default)
-Rate at which elves can spawn (if enabled)
